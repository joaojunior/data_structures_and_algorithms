# Linked List

For the complexity, `n` is the number of items in the LinkedList.
1. Time complexity:
    - Best case:
        - Insert: `O(1)`, we always insert a new item in front of the LinkedList.
        - Delete: `O(1)`, the item to delete is the first element of the LinkedList.
    - Worst case:
        - Insert: `O(1)`, we always insert a new item in front of the LinkedList.
        - Delete: `O(n)`, the item to delete is the last element of the LinkedList.

2. Space Complexity: `O(n)`

# Stack

For the complexity, `n` is the number of items in the Stack. Also, this implementation use the LinkedList to store items.
1. Time complexity:
    - Best case:
        - Push: `O(1)`, we always insert a new item in front of the LinkedList.
        - Pop: `O(1)`, the item to delete is the first element of the LinkedList.
    - Worst case:
        - Push: `O(1)`, we always insert a new item in front of the LinkedList.
        - Pop: `O(1)`, the item to delete is always the first element of the LinkedList.

2. Space Complexity: `O(n)`
